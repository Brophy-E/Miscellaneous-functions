# Miscellaneous-functions
A bunch of handy Python functions for a number different applications. No rhyme or reason in this repository, just some functions I have found help me in my work, whether that is crunching some numbers or automating of some of the boring stuff. The code is mostly my own reproduction of a combination of forums and other GitHub users code, I do not claim ownership/authorship of all the files here. Hope you find something useful!

I will update this repository periodically or as I come across something deemed interesting.
